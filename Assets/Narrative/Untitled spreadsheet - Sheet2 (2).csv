[D1D-16],,The cloudy person who enters the gas station yawns loudly. Her badge seems to twinkle under the industrial lights.
[D1D-17],Zerua, I’m starting a new job outside of the solar system. Do you have Zolkan Coffee perchance? 
[NEGATIVE] ,INCORRECT ITEM OUTCOME, Literally anything else 
[TDN3-1],Zerua, This isn’t quite what I’m looking for… 
[TDN3-2],,"She pulls out her phone and notices the time. It seems to wake her up a little, but not much. "
[TDN3-3],Zerua," Oh! Look at the time. I’ll just figure out a way to stay up when I get there! Tallyho, gas station employee! "
[TDN3-4],Dmi, I have a nametag-- 
[POSITIVE] ,CORRECT ITEM OUTCOME, ZOLKAN COFFEE 
[TDP3-1],Zerua," Oh, my stars! Thank you! "
[TDP3-2],,Before I even placed the drink down for more than a nanosecond. They take a long sip. I don’t think I’ve ever seen anyone drink hot coffee that fast before… 
[TDP3-3],Zerua," Ah, that's better. "
[TDP3-4],,I eye her badge and attempt to make some more conversation. 
[TDP3-5],Dmi, Are you a clouditech? I think I’ve seen a badge like that before. 
[TDP3-6],,She lets out a big smile. It's as if she’s been waiting for you to ask. 
[TDP3-7],Zerua, Yes! I’m starting a new job architecting artificial clouds! I’ve been looking for a job forever. 
[TDP3-8],,She waves her finger above her to-go cup. A mini cloud forms above her cup. Tiny bits of snow come down from it. She smiles proudly. 
[TDP3-9],,I smile too. 
[TDP3-10],Dmi, I hope you have a great time on your first day. 
[TDP3-11],Zerua, Thank you! Please stay safe leaving the solar system soon! Tallyho! 
[D1D-18],,Flubber floats and burps. I smile and give her a pat on the head. 
[D1D-19],,She looks proud of herself. 
[D1D-20],,I jump up from my seat as I hear a boom come from outside. 
[DD1-14],Dmi, What the hell--!? 
[8D-1],8008, Sup. 
[DD1-15],Dmi," Uh, sup? What was that? "
[D1D-21],,He ignores me and his eyes- er...screen look up. 
[8D-2],8008, What was what? 
[DD1-16],Dmi, The boom? 
[8D-3],8008, What boom? 
[DD1-17],Dmi, The-- okay. 
[DD1-18],Dmi, Do you need something? 
[D1D-22],,A low hum comes from his circuits. He’s thinking. 
[8D-4],8008, You sell any Arinator brand stuff here? That one made by that smoking cyborg from outta the solar system? 
[D1D-23],,I’ve heard of Arinator probably. Cassiopeia’s a big fan of singers. Though something was kind of funny about this guy’s desperation. 
[DD1-19],Dmi," I mean, I can check to see what we got. "
[8D-5],8008, Sweet! I’ll also be putting 700 luncos on pump 2. 
[NEGATIVE] ,INCORRECT ITEM OUTCOME, Literally anything else 
[TDN4-1],8008,Bro. 
[TDN4-2],8008, This is NOT Arinator. She only has her face on the cover of all her products dude. 
[TDN4-3],,His facial screen switches to a video of a cyborg woman performing a song on stage. Her fans are screaming their lungs out. 
[TDN4-4],8008, See? You don’t recognize her? 
[TDN4-5],Dmi," Oh, well...I don’t think I really know her stuff. "
[TDN4-6],8008, Fine...I’ll just get gas. 
[TDN4-7],,I stare out the window and watch as 8008 picks up a gas pump and guzzles it straight from the nozzle. His screen shows a sad face with a tear. He then blasts off into space. 
[TDN4-8],,Poor guy. 
[POSITIVE] ,CORRECT ITEM OUTCOME, Arinator Paste + Gas 
[TDP4-1],8008, Yes! Arinator’s limited edition Mint choco paste? I thought this was sold out everywhere! 
[TDP4-5],Dmi," I mean, it's mint chocolate toothpaste isn’t it? "
[TDP4-6],Dmi, I don’t think anyone is in a rush to buy that. 
[TDP4-7],8008, You just don’t understand the intricacies of something like this! Anything she endorses is a godsend! 
[TDP4-8],,He wipes his face (screen?). Then blasts off with his bang of Arinator branded toothpaste in hand. 
[TDP4-9],,Glad he found what he wanted. 
[D1D-24],,An old man enters the gas station. He seems to have some kind of air of caution around him. The way he whips his head around makes him look like he is expecting an attack at any moment. 
[CRD1],Crust," Salutations, Martian. "
[DD1-20],Dmi," Uh, hello? Do you need something, sir? "
[CRD2],Crust," Yes, I actually have a list here… "
[D1D-25],,He pulls out a tiny holosheet and starts to read off of it. 
[CRD3],Crust," I’m looking for duct tape, five laser blasters, a medkit, a flaming katana-- "
[DD1-21],Dmi," Sir, this is a gas station. "
[D1D-26],,He stares blankly at me. 
[CRD4],Crust,...Can I at least get the katana? 
[DD1-22],Dmi, What do you even need a Katana for?! 
[D1D-27],,The man lets out a hearty laugh. He slaps his rocky chest. Pebbles fall off him. 
[CRD5],Crust, Doomsday is in just three days! While you’re in here wasting away working MINIMUM wage! 
[CRD6],Crust," I, Crust, from Mercury, will look at this burning ball of hell gas, and say… "
[DD1-23],Dmi, … 
[CRD7],Crust, No. 
[D1D-28],,He smiles widely. 
[DD1-24],Dmi," Sir, I don’t think you will survive a supernova. "
[CRD8],Crust," I will. Born from the crust of Mercury, I can survive anything. "
[CRD9],Crust, Besides didn’t you hear? The supernova is a cover-up by the intergalactic association-- 
[D1D-29],,"Oh, brother. "
[DD1-25],Dmi, How about this Crust? I can help you get something that can help you out in your… 
[CRD10],Crust, My supernova bunker. 
[DD1-26],Dmi, Your supernova bunker. 
[DD1-27],Dmi, Alright... a nonperishable snack will be good. 
[TDN5-1],Crust," Sorry kid, but I don’t really think something like this is going to be much use in my bunker. "
[TDN5-2],Crust, You sure you don’t have blasters in the back? 
[TDN5-3],Dmi," We’re still just a gas station, sir. "
[TDN5-4],Crust, Alright. 
[TDN5-5],Crust," Stay safe, kid. I gotta go prep my bunker some more. "
[TDP5-1],Crust, Jerky! You’re thinking like a true survivor kid! This is great! 
[TDP5-2],Dmi," Heh, thanks. I just remembered it from a TV show called Survivorz. "
[TDP5-3],,Before you could even ring it up the man opens the bag and starts eating the jerky. 
[TDP5-4],Crust," Hm, you got somewhere to go kid? I can formally invite you to my bunker if ya want. "
[TDP5-5],Dmi," Oh, nah. I’ll be here. "
[TDP5-6],,Crust chokes on a piece of jerky and coughs. He bumps his chest a few times. 
[TDP5-7],Crust, Why? Don’t you got someone special to go home to? 
[TDP5-8],Crust, I’d expect you young’uns to hightail it outta here. 
[TDP5-9],,A familiar face flashes in my mind. My normal bored expression cracks. 
[TDP5-10],Dmi," She’ll be fine without me. Besides, I like to be kept busy. "
[TDP5-11],,Crust doesn’t speak. I listen to his chewing. He rummages in his pocket to give me his luncos. 
[TDP5-12],Crust, Don’t be too sure about that kid. Don’t choose for others how important you are to them. 
[TDP5-13],Crust," I’m gonna be fine when things go down, but you won’t. Talk to who you’re thinking bout. "
[TDP5-14],,I don’t answer. It's a bit surprising I feel I am getting life advice from this apocalyptic junkie of some sort. 
[TDP5-15],,He smiles and waves at me before leaving. I watch the small bits of rock fall to the ground. 
[TDP5-16],,I’ll be cleaning that up. 
[D1D-30],,It's almost closing time… 
[D1D-31],,Flubber lounges in her usual spot. I smile and scratch under her chin. 
[DD1-28],Dmi, We had a good day didn’t we? 
[D1D-23],,I facepalm as I remember I never messaged Cassiopeia back.
