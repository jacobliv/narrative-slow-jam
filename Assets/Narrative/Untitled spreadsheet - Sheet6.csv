[D2D-21],[KD1],,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,,None,Kkili,"She doesn‚Äôt seem to notice the interest, she has a knowing smile as her attention still seems on me and my phone. "

[D2D-27],[D2D-28],,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,,None,Kkili,I choke. When she puts it that way‚Ä¶ 
[D2D-28],[DD2-12],,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,,None,Kkili,I try to search for a way to back out despite this being my fault we‚Äôre having this very personal conversation at a gas station counter. 
[DD2-12],[KD4],,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,,Dmi,Kkili," Is there something, in particular, you‚Äôre looking for or‚Ä¶? "
[KD4],[D2D-29],,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,KKILI1,K‚ÄôKili,Kkili, I see what you‚Äôre doing here.

[DD2-14],[D2D-31],,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,,Dmi,Kkili, Especially if you‚Äôre hungry. 
[D2D-31],[KD7],,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,None,Kkili,She lets out a hearty laugh. 
[KD7],[KD8],,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,KKILI1,K‚ÄôKili,Kkili," Oh, man. I know that feeling when food is good just cuz you haven‚Äôt had anything. "
[KD8],[KD8b],,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,KKILI3,K‚ÄôKili,Kkili, Something with a good crunch to it seems like something my wife would like.

[TDN9-5],[TDN9-6],,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,KKILI3,K‚ÄôKili,Kkili, Pretty sure I‚Äôd know what she likes best. 
[TDN9-6],[TDN9-7],,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,,None,Kkili,I sigh. Seems my gas station munchies intuition failed me today.

[TDN9-8],[D2D-32],,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,KKILI1,K‚ÄôKili,Kkili, It's fine. I‚Äôll take the gas at least. 
[TDP9-1],[TDP9-2],,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,KKILI2,K‚ÄôKili,Kkili, What are these called again? M‚ÄôGhooni Nachos? 
[TDP9-2],[TDP9-3],,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,,Dmi,Kkili, It's got a little kick to it. If your wife likes spice I‚Äôm sure she‚Äôd be into it. 
[TDP9-3],[TDP9-4],,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,KKILI3,K‚ÄôKili,Kkili, I‚Äôm Martian. I can handle more than a little kick.

[TDP9-6],[TDP9-7],,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,,Dmi,Kkili," Yeah, my friend would usually call me to bring some back with me back when we were roommates. "
[TDP9-7],[TDP9-8],,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,KKILI1,K‚ÄôKili,Kkili, They‚Äôve got good taste. Can you get one for me too? 
[TDP9-8],[D2D-32],,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,None,Kkili,I nod as I go over to the machine and get out a second batch of M‚ÄôGhooni Nachos. 
[D2D-32],[KD9],,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,None,Kkili,The woman grabs her wallet in her pocket.

[DD2-15],[D2D-33],,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,,Dmi,Kkili, Nothing stops at Cosmic Fuel for Doomsday. 
[D2D-33],[D2D-34],,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,None,Kkili,The woman cooly passes a card to me. I grab for it and freeze as I realize she passed me an ID. 
[D2D-34],[D2D-35],,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,,None,Kkili,"The name is one I remember very well, as it was all over the Martian news. "
[D2D-35],[KD10],,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,,None,Kkili,Holy crap. This woman is like‚Ä¶ an urban legend on Mars. 
[KD10],[D2D-36],,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,KKili_Short,K‚ÄôKili,Kkili, Did my card decline? 
[D2D-36],[KD11],,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,None,Kkili,All six of her eyes widen as she realizes her debit card isn‚Äôt in my hand and she snatches it.

[D2D-37],[D2D-38],,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,None,Kkili,K‚ÄôKili passes me the right card.

[DD2-17],[D2D-39],,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,,Dmi,Kkili, You‚Äôre not going to throw me in the nearest black hole and take my place aren‚Äôt you? 
[D2D-39],[KD13],,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,None,Kkili,K‚ÄôKili laughs. 
[KD13],[DD2-18],,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,KKILI3,K‚ÄôKili,Kkili, Not at all. I didn‚Äôt really use my powers like that. I can‚Äôt really shapeshift anymore anyways. 
[DD2-18],[D2D-40],,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,,Dmi,Kkili, Oh? 
[D2D-40],[KD14],,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,None,Kkili,She points to her antenna.

[D2D-41],[KD16],,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,None,Kkili,K‚ÄôKili lifts up her hand to show her ring. I can see the admiration and pride coming from her. 
[KD16],[DD2-19],,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,KKILI3,K‚ÄôKili,Kkili, My wife means everything to me. A part of me is happy we can get away and start new somewhere else.

[KD17],[D2D-42],,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,KKili_Short,K‚ÄôKili,Kkili, I‚Äôm the lucky one. 
[D2D-42],[KD18],,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,None,Kkili,K‚ÄôKili reaches over and places a hand on my shoulder. She has a strong grip. She probably could pull me over the counter like this.
